## 🧠 Concept

This indicator helps identify **entry candles** using the **confluence** of:

- Support & Resistance
- Smart Money Concepts (SMC)
- Pivots
- Trendlines
- Order Blocks
- Buy reversal
- sell reversal

It works for **Intraday**, **Swing**, and **Positional Trading**.

## 📌 Rules to Follow

1. **Identify Key Zones:**
   - Mark Support and Resistance using SMC, Pivots, or Trendlines (your choice).
  
2. **Watch for Signals:**
   - At **Support**, look for a **bullish signal** (e.g. green/confirmation candle).
   - At **Resistance**, look for a **bearish signal** (e.g. red candle rejection).

3. **Do Not Get Faked Out:**
   - A candle touching support/resistance but **not closing beyond it** is **not** a breakout/breakdown.
   - Breakout/Breakdown must **close beyond** the zone and then retest is ideal for entry.

4. **Entry Strategy:**
   - Enter on signal confirmation.
   - Use **small lot size initially**.
   - Add positions around OHLC levels of the signal candle:
     - High → Close → HL2
   - This helps tighten SL and improve RR.

5. **Psychological Note:**
   - If a counter signal forms during a valid setup retest, **do not panic**.
   - Stay in the trade as long as SL is not hit.

[This is a unique Script which uses BB Squeeze, to identify consolidation and breakout. As well it works as a momentum indicator, like MACD with signal crosses, and RSI overbought and oversold levels][df1]

## 🔁 Swing/Positional/Investment Strategy

- Use **Weekly Charts** for long-term trades.
- Look for:
  - **Breakout of swing high**
  - **Retest of the breakout zone**
  - **Presence of Order Block** or valid SMC level
- If the zone holds, consider it a **long-term buy zone**.
- **Confluence with Order Block** increases reliability.

## 📷 Chart Example Breakdown

- **Buy Entry**: Near 25000 with confluence at support zone.
- **Sell Entry**: Near 25359 near resistance zone with bearish rejection.
- **Reversal Zones**: Clearly marked with breakout/breakdown and pivot levels.
